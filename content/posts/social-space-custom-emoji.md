We've added custom emoji for all users of our Social Space to enjoy.
This post will explain what we've added, and how to use them.

## Social Space's Custom Emoji

We've added custom emoji from a variety of sources.
Below is a list of various emoji sets we've added, along with links to their respective websites and the category they are under in the emoji picker.

{{<emoji-table>}}

Many of the emoji will be available in the emoji picker.
For emoji that are not in the picker, you can use the emoji shortcode to insert them into your posts.
We'll describe those cases below.

### Mutant Standard

We have the Mutant Standard emoji available as custom emoji.
They can be found under the "Mutant Standard" category in the emoji picker.
To prevent clutter and performance issues, only the base versions of emoji are included (including morph modifiers: human, claw, hoof, paw) in the emoji picker.
We also have all versions with color modifiers, but they are not in the emoji picker.
You can access these by using the color code suffixes, as shown in the table below.

We have also modified some of the shortcodes to better group them together within the emoji picker.

NOTE: In the table the human and paw hand morphs are used for color modifiers that only work with those specific morphs.
The claw morph is used for color modifiers that work with all morphs.
Also, the `k2` color modifier is the default color for colorable emoji
The `k2` color modifier is available when the user wants to explicitly say that character is the `k2` color.
